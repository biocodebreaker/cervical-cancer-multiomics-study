# Cervical Cancer Multi-Omics Study

## Project Overview
This project focuses on summarizing publicly available multi-omics datasets related to cervical cancer, including genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, epigenetics (methylation), proteomics, and single-cell sequencing. The goal is to provide a FAIR-compliant (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) resource for reproducible research.

All analyses are conducted in R, with version control maintained through this GitHub repository, and the document will be published using Quarto/Markdown.

## Objectives
- **Summarize multi-omics datasets**: Create a comprehensive summary of datasets found in the published literature.
- **Ensure FAIR Principles**: Make datasets Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
- **Reproducible Workflow**: Ensure reproducibility using GitHub for version control and Quarto for publishing.
- **Cervical Cancer Focus**: Concentrate on datasets that contribute to understanding the biology and treatment of cervical cancer.
