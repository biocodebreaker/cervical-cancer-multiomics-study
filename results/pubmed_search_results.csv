However, a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis is currently lacking. Methods: Utilizing the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, the roles of ADRA2C in human pan-cancer were analyzed through a variety of bioinformatics approaches, including R programming language and single-cell sequencing data analysis, et al. Besides, cell migration assay and immunochemistry were employed to further validate the role of ADRA2C in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines and GBM mouse model. Results: A total of 33 cancer types were involved in this study. It was revealed that the expression level of ADRA2C varied across different clinical stages in patients with breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), esophageal adenocarcinoma (ESCA), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Meanwhile, it was found that ADRA2C may play roles in prognosis of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), glioblastoma multiforme and lower grade glioma (GBM-LGG), and uveal melanoma (UVM). Functional enrichment analysis suggested that ADRA2C expression level was highly correlated with neuronal system-related pathways. Moreover, ADRA2C may be a promising diagnostic marker for cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), GBM, GBMLGG, kidney chromophobe (KICH), and KIRP. Additionally, ADRA2C expression level was correlated with the levels of several infiltrating cells and immune checkpoint genes. Besides, the single-cell sequencing data analysis indicated that ADRA2C played a role in multiple tumor development processes in GBM, retinoblastoma (RB), and UVM. Finally, in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that the expression level of ADRA2C may be associated with glioma cell migration, apoptosis, and invasion. Conclusion: ADRA2C exhibited to play a notable role in several cancer types, suggesting that ADRA2C could serve as a promising biomarker or target for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, particularly for GBM.","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","Journal Article"

A pan-cancer analysis was conducted on VDR in CESC, with a focus on its expression and relationship with immune infiltration and genetic alterations. Bioinformatics databases, including TIMER, GEPIA, UALCAN, cBioportal, and Kaplan-Meier Plotter, have been utilized. VDR expression in CESC has been validated using publicly available data. Results were significantly upregulated (P=0.05) in THCA, BRCA, KICH, LUAD, LIHC, STAD, UCEC, CESC, CHOL, ESCA, and HNSC samples. We analyzed the correlation between VDR expression and various clinicopathological factors such as age, race, and cancer stage. VDR expression was significantly upregulated across all age groups, with the highest levels observed in older adults followed by young and middle-aged adults. VDR gene expression was significantly elevated across all races, including Caucasians, African-Americans, and Asians, compared to that in the normal group. Furthermore, VDR expression was significantly upregulated in cancer stages 1, 2, 3, and 4, with the highest increase observed in stage 3 compared to that in normal individuals. We analyzed the expression of the VDR in relation to immune cell type and tumor cell purity in CESC. Our results indicated that VDR expression was positively correlated with neutrophils and dendritic cells and negatively correlated with tumor cell purity in CESC patients. There was no significant correlation between VDR expression and the abundance of B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages. Our study found no significant effect of VDR expression on patient prognosis, although it was positively correlated with CD4+ T cells. The Cox proportional hazards model indicated that age and immune cells did not significantly affect prognosis. Most VDR mutations are concentrated in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with an amplification frequency of 4% and a deep deletion frequency of 2.2%. GEO confirmed VDR expression in CESC, identifying 1515 upregulated and 1877 downregulated genes, with volcano plots showing CESC downregulation in patients.","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","Journal Article"

This comprehensive bioinformatics study transcends traditional boundaries, investigating the prognostic and therapeutic potential of S100A9 across diverse neoplastic entities. Leveraging a wide array of bioinformatics tools and publicly available cancer genomics databases, such as TCGA, we systematically examined the S100A9 gene. Our approach included differential expression analysis, mutational burden assessment, protein interaction networks, and survival analysis. This robust computational framework provided a high-resolution view of S100A9's role in cancer biology. The study meticulously explored S100A9's oncogenic facets, incorporating comprehensive analyses of its relationship with prognosis, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA methylation, and immune cell infiltration across various tumor types. This study presents a panoramic view of S100A9 expression across a spectrum of human cancers, revealing a heterogeneous expression landscape. Elevated S100A9 expression was detected in malignancies such as BLCA (Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma), CESC (Cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma), COAD (Colon adenocarcinoma), ESCA (Esophageal carcinoma), and GBM (Glioblastoma multiforme), while reduced expression was noted in BRCA (Breast invasive carcinoma), HNSC (Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma), and KICH (Kidney Chromophobe). This disparate expression pattern suggests that S100A9's role in cancer biology is multifaceted and context-dependent. Prognostically, S100A9 expression correlates variably with patient outcomes across different cancer types. Furthermore, its expression is intricately associated with TMB and MSI in nine cancer types. Detailed examination of six selected tumors-BRCA, CESC, KIRC (Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma), LUSC (Lung squamous cell carcinoma), SKCM (Skin Cutaneous Melanoma); STAD (Stomach adenocarcinoma)-revealed a negative correlation of S100A9 expression with the infiltration of most immune cells, but a positive correlation with neutrophils, M1 macrophages, and activated NK cells, highlighting the complex interplay between S100A9 and the tumor immune environment. This bioinformatics synthesis posits S100A9 as a significant player in cancer progression, offering valuable prognostic insights. The data underscore the utility of S100A9 as a prognostic biomarker and its potential as a therapeutic target. The therapeutic implications are profound, suggesting that modulation of S100A9 activity could significantly impact cancer management strategies.","Humans|Calgranulin B|Computational Biology|Neoplasms|Prognosis|Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic|Biomarkers, Tumor|DNA Methylation|Microsatellite Instability|Mutation|Protein Interaction Maps","Calgranulin B|S100A9 protein, human|Biomarkers, Tumor","2022 State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine","B2024049","","NA","Journal Article"

However, the role of APOBEC3A in cervical cancer remains to be clarified. Methods: We used bioinformatics to investigate APOBEC3A expression and outcomes using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC) dataset, GTEx, and GSE7803. Immunohistochemistry was then used to identify APOBEC3A's expression pattern. We performed Cell Counting Kit-8, wound-healing, Transwell, and flow cytometry assays to measure proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, respectively, using the SiHa and HeLa cell lines transfected with APOBEC3A. BALB/c nude mice were used to investigate the effects of APOBEC3A in vivo. The phosphorylated gamma-H2AX staining assay was applied to measure DNA damage. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was applied to explore APOBEC3A-related signaling pathways. Results: APOBEC3A was more significantly expressed in cancer tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. Higher expression of APOBEC3A was associated with better outcomes in TCGA-CESC and GTEx. Immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of APOBEC3A was significantly higher in cancer tissues than in normal tissues. Transfection experiments showed that APOBEC3A inhibited proliferation, upregulated S-phase cells, inhibited migration and invasion, induced DNA damage, and promoted apoptosis. Overexpression of APOBEC3A inhibited tumor formation in the mouse model. RNA-seq analysis showed that ectopic expression of APOBEC3A inhibited several cancer-associated signaling pathways. Conclusions: APOBEC3A is significantly upregulated in cervical cancer, and higher expression of APOBEC3A is associated with better outcomes.

S100 calcium-binding proteins possess broad biological functions, such as cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, tumor metastasis, and inflammation (Nat Rev Cancer 15:96-109, 2015). The S100A16 protein was initially isolated from a cell line derived from astrocytoma. The S100A16 protein, consisting of 103 amino acids, is a small acidic protein with a molecular weight of 11,801.4 Da and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.28 (Biochem Biophys Res Commun 313:237-244, 2004). This protein exhibits high conservation among mammals and is widely expressed in various human tissues (Biochem Biophys Res Commun 322:1111-1122, 2004). Like other S100 proteins, S100A16 contains two EF-hand motifs that form a helix-loop-helix structural domain. The N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of S100A16 are connected by a ""hinge"" linker.S100A16 protein exhibits distinct characteristics that distinguish it from other S100 proteins. A notable feature is the presence of a single functional Ca2 + binding site located in the C-terminal EF-hand, consisting of 12 amino acids per protein monomer (J Biol Chem 281:38905-38917, 2006). In contrast, the N-terminal EF-hand of S100A16 comprises 15 amino acids instead of the typical 14, and it lacks the conserved glutamate residue at the final position. This unique attribute may contribute to the impaired Ca2 + binding capability in the N-terminal region (J Biol Chem 281:38905-38917, 2006). Studies have shown an integral role of S100 calcium-binding proteins in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of certain diseases (Cancers 12:2037, 2020). Abnormal expression of S100A16 protein is implicated in the progression of breast and prostate cancer, but an inhibitor of oral cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumor cell proliferation (BMC Cancer 15:53, 2015; BMC Cancer 15:631, 2015). Tu et al. (Front Cell Dev Biol 9:645641, 2021) indicate that the overexpression of S100A16 mRNA in cervical cancer(CC) such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma as compared to the control specimens. Tomiyama N. and co-workers (Oncol Lett 15:9929-9933, 2018) (Tomiyama, N) investigated the role of S100A16 in cancer stem cells using Yumoto cells (a CC cell line),The authors found upregulation of S100A16 in Yumoto cells following sphere formation as compared to monolayer culture.Despite a certain degree of understanding, the exact biological function of S100A16 in CC is still unclear. This article explores the role of S100A16 in CC through a bioinformatics analysis. Referencing the mRNA expression and SNP data of cervical cancer available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we analyzed S100A16 and its associated regulatory gene expression network in cervical cancer. We further screened genes co-expressed with S100A16 to hypothesize their function and relationship to the S100A16 cervical cancer phenotype.Our results showed that data mining can effectively elucidate the expression and gene regulatory network of S100A16 in cervical cancer, laying the foundation for further investigations into S100A16 cervical tumorigenesis.","Male|Female|Animals|Humans|Uterine Cervical Neoplasms|Carcinoma, Squamous Cell|Gene Regulatory Networks|S100 Proteins|Amino Acids|Data Mining|RNA, Messenger|Mammals","S100 Proteins|Amino Acids|RNA, Messenger|S100A16 protein, human","NA","NA","NA","NA","Journal Article"

Therefore, further study of the gene in relation with cancer progression needs to be conducted. In the current study, investigators used TCGA data to determine the potential carcinogenic effect of SMYD2 in 11 cancer types.

Methods: A retrospective observational study combined with bioinformatics analysis was used. The RNA expression profile data of USP7 in tumor and/or its corresponding paracancular normal tissue were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and the RNA sequencing data were transformed by log2. The variations of USP7 gene were analyzed by cBioPortal database. The USP7 mRNA expression in tumor and adjacent normal tissue in TCGA database were obtained by using the ""Gene_DE"" module in TIMER 2.0 database. The survival rates of patients with high and low USP7 expression in cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) were analyzed using the Gene Expression Profile Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2) database, and the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were drawn. Sangerbox database was used to analyze the correlation of USP7 expression in pan-cancer with microsatellite instability (MSI) or tumor mutation burden (TMB) pan-cancer. Through the ""correlation analysis"" module in the GEPIA2 database, the correlation of USP7 expression in pan-cancer with the expression levels of five DNA mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and EPCAM) and three essential DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)--DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B were evaluated. The USP7 expression in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM and its correlation with infiltration of immune cells (B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells) were analyzed by the ""Immune-Gene"" module in TIMER 2.0 database. The ""Similar Genes Detection"" module of GEPIA2 database was used to obtain the top 100 protein sets with similar expression patterns to USP7. Intersection analysis was performed between the aforementioned protein sets and the top 50 protein sets that were directly physically bound to USP7 obtained by using the STRING database. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed for the two protein sets mentioned above using the DAVID database. The samples of normal skin, hypertrophic scar, scar ulcer, and scar carcinoma with corresponding clinicopathologic features were collected from the Department of Pathology of Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University & Wuhan Third Hospital from October 2018 to October 2022, and the USP7 expression in tissue was detected by immunohistochemical method, with the number of samples of 6. Data were statistically analyzed with Log-rank test, one-way analysis of variance, and Bonferroni test. Results: In pan-cancer, the main gene variations of USP7 were mutation and amplification, and the top 3 tumors with the highest variation frequency (>6%) were bladder urothelial carcinoma, SKCM, and endometrial carcinoma. The main mutation of USP7 gene in pan-cancer was missense mutation. In SKCM with the highest mutation frequency, the main type of mutation was missense mutation in USP7_ICP0_bdg domain. USP7 mRNA expression in breast invasive carcinoma, bile duct carcinoma, colon carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, HNSC, renal chromophobe cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, LUSC, prostate carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma was significantly higher than that in corresponding paracancer normal tissue (P<0.05). USP7 mRNA expression in glioblastoma multiforme, renal clear cell carcinoma, renal papillary cell carcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma was significantly lower than that in corresponding paracancular normal tissue (P<0.05). In addition, USP7 mRNA expression in SKCM metastases was much higher than that in primary tumor tissue (P<0.05). Survival curves showed no significant difference in survival rate between patients with high USP7 expression and patients with low USP7 expression in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM (Log-rank P>0.05, with hazard ratios of 1.00, 0.99, 1.00, and 1.30, respectively). USP7 expression in colon cancer, colorectal cancer, thymic cancer, and thyroid cancer was negatively correlated with TMB (with Pearson correlation coefficients of -0.26, -0.19, -0.19, and 0.11, respectively, P<0.05). USP7 expression in glioma, CESC, lung adenocarcinoma, mixed renal carcinoma, and LUSC was positively correlated with MSI expression (with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.22, 0.14, 0.15, 0.08, and 0.14, respectively, P<0.05), and USP7 expression in colon cancer, colorectal cancer, invasive breast cancer, prostate cancer, HNSC, thyroid cancer, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were significantly negatively correlated with MSI expression (with Pearson correlation coefficients of -0.31, -0.27, -0.13, -0.19, -0.16, -0.18, and -0.53, respectively, P<0.05). The expression of USP7 in CESC was positively correlated with that of both MSH2 and MSH6 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.51 and 0.44, respectively, P<0.05), and the expression of USP7 in HNSC was positively correlated with the expression of EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.39, 0.14, 0.49, 0.54, and 0.41, respectively, P<0.05), and the expression of USP7 in LUSC was positively correlated with the expression of EPCAM, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.20, 0.36, 0.40, and 0.34, respectively, P<0.05), and the expression of USP7 in SKCM was positively correlated with the expression of EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.11, 0.33, 0.42, 0.55, and 0.34, respectively, P<0.05). The expression of USP7 in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM was significantly positively correlated with the expression of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.42, 0.34, 0.22, 0.45, 0.52, 0.22, 0.36, 0.36, 0.22, 0.38, 0.46, and 0.21, respectively, P<0.05). The expression of USP7 in CESC, HNSC, LUSC, and SKCM was positively correlated with CD4+ T cell infiltration (with Partial correlation coefficients of 0.14, 0.22, 0.13, and 0.16, respectively, P<0.05). Being similar to the pattern of USP7 expression and ranked among top 100 protein sets, the top 5 proteins were C16orf72, BCLAF1, UBN, GSPT1, ERI2 (with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.83, 0.74, 0.73, and 0.72, respectively, all P values<0.05). The top 50 protein sets that directly physically bind to USP7 overlapped with the aforementioned protein set by only one protein, thyroid hormone receptor interaction factor 12. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that USP7 related genes were involved in cell cycle, spliceosome, cell senescence, and p53 signal pathway. GO enrichment analysis showed that USP7 related genes were involved in transcriptional regulation, protein ubiquitination, DNA repair, and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptor signal pathways. Analysis of clinical samples showed that USP7 expression was significantly higher in hypertrophic scars (0.35±0.05), scar ulcers (0.43±0.04), and scar cancers (0.61±0.03) than in normal skin (0.18±0.04), P<0.05.

The effects of IGLCs on patient clinical phenotypes and prognosis were explored via bioinformatics analyses based on the TCGA databases. We used the bioinformatics analyses based on the TCGA and GTEx databases to elucidate the correlations among IGLC expressions, immunomodulator expressions, tumor stemness, and infiltration scores of tumor infiltrating immune cells. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and silver staining combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used to obtain potential tumor-derived Igλ-interacting proteins.

The expressions of IGLC5 and IGLC7 had significant difference in different pathologic metastasis (M), one of tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system, categories of CESC. Except for disease-free interval (DFI), 4 IGLC (IGLC1, IGLC2, IGLC3, and IGLC7) expression levels were positively associated with patient overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI) respectively in CESC tissues. 5 IGLC (IGLC1, IGLC2, IGLC3, IGLC6, and IGLC7) expressions were positively correlated with the expressions of a majority of immunomodulators respectively in CESC tissues. Tumor stemness was negatively correlated with the expressions of 4 IGLCs (IGLC1, IGLC2, IGLC3, and IGLC7) respectively in CESC tissues.

Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were measured using an automated biochemical analyzer. Renal tissue morphology was observed through HE staining, while TUNEL staining was performed to detect apoptosis in renal tubular cells. ELISA was conducted to measure levels of oxidative stress-related factors in mouse serum and cell supernatant. An in vitro cell model of RKI was established using X-ray irradiation on HK-2 cells for mechanism validation. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the relative expression of PARP1 mRNA.

CpG-ODNs may alleviate RKI by inhibiting DNA damage and oxidative stress levels. This resulted in significantly decreased levels of BUN and creatinine in RKI mice, as well as reduced renal tubular and glomerular damage, lower apoptosis rate, decreased DNA damage index (8-OHdG), and increased levels of antioxidant factors associated with oxidative stress (SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx). Among the CpG-ODNs, CpG-ODN2006 had a more pronounced effect. CpG-ODNs mediated the inhibition of PARP1, thereby suppressing DNA damage and oxidative stress response in vitro in HK-2 cells. Additionally, PARP1 promoted the formation of the PARP1 and XRCC1 complex by recruiting XRCC1, which in turn facilitated DNA damage and oxidative stress response in renal tubular cells.

Notably, CCL5 might be an independent predictive biomarker of clinical outcome in SKCM patients, confirmed by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Furthermore, we acquired the genetic alteration status of CCL5 in multiple types of tumor tissues from TCGA cohorts. We revealed a potential correlation between the expression level of CCL5 and tumor mutational burden in 33 types of tumors. In addition, data showed that DNA methylation was associated with CCL5 gene expression in THCA, PRAD, LUSC, and BRCA cancers. Immune infiltration and immune checkpoints are fine indexes for evaluating immunotherapy. We uncovered that CCL5 was negatively correlated with the immune infiltration of CD8+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, macrophages, and gamma delta T cells in BRCA-basal and CESC tumors, while a significant positive correlation was observed in BLCA, COAD and other 7 types of tumors. Besides, CCL5 was closely associated with the immune checkpoint molecules in 8 types of tumors. The TIDE score was less in the CCL5 high-expressed group than in the CCL5 low-expressed group in SKCM patients, which indicated that CCL5 might be a fine monitor of immune response for immunotherapy. GO enrichment analysis data uncovered that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling might be involved in the role of CCL5 in regulating tumor pathogenesis and prognosis.|In conclusion, CCL5 was preliminarly identified as a biomarker of immune response and prognosis for tumors patients via our first comprehensive pan-cancer analysis.","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","Journal Article"

In this study, we examined the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of FAM64A mRNA expression in gynecological cancers. We conducted a bioinformatics analysis of FAM64A mRNA expression using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), xiantao, The University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN), and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter databases. FAM64A expression was elevated in breast, cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers when compared with normal tissue. Expression was positively correlated with white race, low T stages, infiltrating ductal carcinoma, or favourable PAM50 classification in breast cancer patients, and with clinical stage, histological grade and TP53 mutation, and endometrial cancer serous subtype. FAM64A expression was negatively associated with overall and/or recurrence-free survival rates in breast and endometrial cancer patients, while the opposite was observed in cervical and ovarian cancer patients. FAM64A functioned as an independent predictor of overall and disease-specific survival in breast cancer patients. FAM64A-correlated genes were involved in ligand-receptor interactions, and chromosomal, cell cycle, and DNA replication processes in breast, cervical, endometrial and ovarian cancers. Top hub genes primarily included cell cycle-related proteins in breast cancer, mucins and acetylgalactosaminyl transferases in cervical cancer, kinesin family members in endometrial cancer, and synovial sarcoma X and the cancer/testis antigen in ovarian cancer. FAM64A mRNA expression was positively related to Th2 cell infiltration, but negatively associated with neutrophil and Th17 cell infiltration in breast, cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. FAM64A expression may be considered a potential biomarker reflecting carcinogenesis, histogenesis, aggressive behaviour, and prognosis in gynecological cancers.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? FAM64A is located in cell nucleolar and nucleoplasmic regions, and during mitosis it putatively controls metaphase-to-anaphase transition. FAM64A appears to regulate different physiological processes, including apoptosis, tumorigenesis, neural differentiation, stress responses, and the cell cycle.What the results of this study add? FAM64A expression was up-regulated in breast, cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancers, and positively correlated with white race, low T stages, infiltrating ductal carcinoma, or favourable PAM50 classification in breast cancer patients, and with clinical stage, histological grade, and TP53 mutation, and a serous subtype in endometrial cancer.

Because of the high dimension and small sample size of the omic data, or the use of biomarkers generated from a single omic data, the diagnosis of cervical cancer may be inaccurate and unreliable. The purpose of this study was to search the GEO and TCGA databases for potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of CESC. We begin by downloading CESC (GSE30760) DNA methylation data from GEO, then perform differential analysis on the downloaded methylation data and screen out the differential genes. Then, using estimation algorithms, we score immune cells and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment and perform survival analysis on the gene expression profile data and the most recent clinical data of CESC from TCGA. Then, using the 'limma' package and Venn plot in R language to perform differential analysis of genes and screen out overlapping genes, these overlapping genes were then subjected to GO and KEGG functional enrichment analysis. The differential genes screened by the GEO methylation data and the differential genes screened by the TCGA gene expression data were intersected to screen out the common differential genes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of gene expression data was then created in order to discover important genes. The PPI network's key genes were crossed with previously identified common differential genes to further validate them. The Kaplan-Meier curve was then used to determine the prognostic importance of the key genes.

In addition, gene ontology (GO) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed to identify potential molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, data from 115 CESC patients from East Hospital were used to help identify the relationship between the protein expressions of key genes and disease-free survival using tissue microarray technology. Cases of CESC (n = 303) were divided into five subtypes (C1-C5) based on their expression profiles. A total of 69 cross-validated differentially expressed immune-related genes were identified. Subtype C4 demonstrated a downregulation of the immune profile, lower tumor immune/stroma scores, and worse prognosis. In contrast, the C1 subtype showed an upregulation of the immune profile, higher tumor immune/stroma scores, and better prognosis.

Then, the DAVID website was used to perform Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. These protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGS were visualized and analyzed using the STRING website and the hub genes were further screened using the Cytohubba plugin. Lastly, the functions of the hub genes were further analyzed by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) online tools, Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases, and the QuartataWeb database. RESULTS In the 4 Profile datasets, 101 cancer tissues and 67 normal tissues were collected. Among the 78 differentially expressed genes in the 4 datasets, 51 genes were upregulated and 27 genes were downregulated. The PPIs of these differentially expressed genes were visualized using Cytoscape and the Interaction Gene Search Tool (STRING). Then, further analysis of hub genes using the GEPIA tool and Kaplan-Meier curves that showed upregulation of CDK1 and PRC1 is associated with better survival, while AURKA is associated with worse survival. Among these hub genes, only AURKA was closely related to the prognosis of cervical cancer, and 21 potential drugs were found.

Therefore, identifying potential biomarkers can help us better understand the underlying mechanism. From the GEO database, four profiles of gastrointestinal cancers were gathered for the screening process, and six hub genes were found by bioinformatics analysis. Collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), one of the hub genes, is a component of the extracellular matrix and is critical for tumor microenvironment. However, the expression level, signaling pathway, prognostic prediction, and immunological value of COL1A1 in different cancers remain unclear. Methods: We comprehensively analyzed gene expression and genetic alteration patterns of COL1A1 among 33 types of malignancies from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Besides, we explored the correlation of COL1A1 with cancer prognosis, immune infiltrates, PD-L1, tumor mutational burden (TMB)/microsatellite instability status (MSI), and the pathway and drug sensitivity of co-expressed genes. Results: The results showed that COL1A1 was highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis in the majority of cancers. The most common alteration type of COL1A1 was missense mutation, and COL1A1 was associated with poor prognosis in KIRP, LGG, MESO, SKCM, and STAD. For the immunologic significance, COL1A1 expression was closely related to high TMB in THYM, LAML, ACC, KICH, PRAD, and LGG, and high MSI in TGCT, MESO, PRAD, COAD, SARC, and CESC. In addition, COL1A1 was positively correlated with the abundance of CAFs, macrophages, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. However, it was negatively correlated with CD8+ T cells mainly in CESC, HNSC-HPV+, and SKCM. Besides, as a component of the extracellular matrix, COL1A1 was involved in the activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and high expression of HTRA1 was resistant to multiple drugs. Conclusion: COL1A1 can serve as a prognostic and immunological biomarker in different cancers.","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","Journal Article"

Herein, we performed an integrated bioinformatics analysis to establish an immune-gene signature and immune-associated nomogram for predicting prognosis of CSCC patients. Methods: The list of immunity-associated genes was retrieved from ImmPort database. The gene and clinical information of CSCC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website. The immune gene signature for predicting overall survival (OS) of CSCC patients was constructed using the univariate Cox-regression analysis, random survival forests, and multivariate Cox-regression analysis. This signature was externally validated in GSE44001 cohort from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Then, based on the established signature and the TCGA cohort with the corresponding clinical information, a nomogram was constructed and evaluated via Cox regression analysis, concordance index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots and decision curve analyses (DCAs). Results: A 5-immune-gene prognostic signature for CSCC was established. Low expression of ICOS, ISG20 and high expression of ANGPTL4, SBDS, LTBR were risk factors for CSCC prognosis indicating poor OS. Based on this signature, the OS was significantly worse in high-risk group than in low-risk group (p-value < 0.001), the area under curves (AUCs) for 1-, 3-, 5-years OS were, respectively, 0.784, 0.727, and 0.715. A nomogram incorporating the risk score of signature and the clinical stage was constructed. The C-index of this nomogram was 0.76. AUC values were 0.811, 0.717, and 0.712 for 1-, 3-, 5-years OS. The nomogram showed good calibration and gained more net benefits than the 5-immune-gene signature and the clinical stage. Conclusion: The 5-immune-gene signature may serve as a novel, independent predictor for prognosis in patients with CSCC. The nomogram incorporating the signature risk score and clinical stage improved the predictive performance than the signature and clinical stage alone for predicting 1-year OS.","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","Journal Article"

However, the role and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in cervical cancer (CC) remain unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the function of hsa_ circ_0101119 on CC and its potential mechanisms. The differentially expressed circRNAs associated with CC were screened out using R software, according to the database of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The expression levels of hsa_circ_0101119, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A‑3 (EIF4A3) and transcription elongation factor A‑like 6 (TCEAL6) in CC cells were detected via reverse transcription‑quantitative (RT‑q)PCR, and their expression levels in CC tissues were analyzed based on the database of GEO and the Cancer Genome Atlas. Moreover, the accurate functions of hsa_circ_0101119 and TCEAL6 on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of SiHa and HeLa cells was examined using colony formation assay, 5‑ethynyl‑20‑deoxyuridine incorporation assay, flow cytometry and Transwell assay. Next, the underlying mechanisms of hsa_circ_0101119 on CC progression were determined via bioinformatics analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation assay, RNA pull down assay, RT‑qPCR and western blotting. It was found that hsa_circ_0101119 was highly expressed in CC tissues and cells, while TCEAL6 was lowly expressed. Knockdown of hsa_circ_0101119 or TCEAL6 overexpression significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of SiHa and HeLa cells, but facilitated apoptosis. It was also demonstrated that hsa_circ_0101119 could recruit EIF4A3 to inhibit TCEAL6 expression in CC. Furthermore, knockdown of TCEAL6 could reverse the effects of silencing hsa_circ_0101119 on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of HeLa cells.

In addition, genes and pathways involved in PD-1 and modulating tumor immune status were identified. We select the EC transcriptomic dataset in TCGA to retrieve gene sets on the cBioPortal platform, and the PD-1 coexpressed genes were obtained on the platform. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of coexpressed genes was performed using the DAVID database. The target protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using Cytoscape 3.7.1 software, and the hub genes were then screened. A total of 976 coexpression genes were obtained. The enrichment analysis showed that PD-1 coexpressed genes were significantly enriched in overall components of the cell structure, the interaction of cytokines with cytokine receptors, chemokine signaling pathways, and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs).

The functional enrichment analysis was performed using g:Profiler tool. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and hub genes identification were performed using the STRING database and Cytoscape software, respectively. The hub genes were subjected to expression and survival analysis in the cervical cancer. The EdU incorporation and Cell Counting Kit-8 assays were performed to evaluate the effects of hub gene knockdown on the proliferation of cervical cancer cells.|A total of 89 overlapping DEGs (63 up-regulated and 26 down-regulated genes) were identified in the microarray datasets. The functional enrichment analysis indicated that the overlapping DEGs were mainly associated with ""DNA replication"" and ""cell cycle"". Furthermore, the PPI network analysis revealed that the network contains 87 nodes and 309 edges. Sub-module analysis using the Molecular Complex Detection tool identified 21 hub genes from the PPI network. The expression levels of the 21 hub genes were all up-regulated in the cervical cancer tissues when compared to normal cervical tissues as analysed by GEPIA tool. The survival analysis showed that the low expression of cell division cycle 45 (CDC45), GINS complex subunit 2 (GINS2), minichromosome maintenance complex component 2 (MCM2) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was significantly correlated with the shorter overall survival of patients with cervical cancer. Moreover, the protein expression levels of GINS2, MCM2 and PCNA, but not CDC45, were significantly up-regulated in the cervical cancer tissues when compared to normal cervical tissues. Finally, knockdown of MCM2 significantly suppressed the proliferation of HeLa and SiHa cells.|In conclusion, we screened a total of 89 overlapping DEGs from the GEO datasets, and further analysis identified four hub genes (CDC45, GINS2, MCM2 and PCNA) that were likely associated with the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer. MCM2 knockdown repressed the cervical cancer cell proliferation.

This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of family with sequence similarity 83, member A (FAM83A) gene and miR-206 in promoting CC progression and the involved genetic signaling pathways. Method: This was a bioinformatic analysis study based on RNA sequencing data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases and verification by in vivo and in vitro experimental data. It was designed to evaluate whether the aberrantly expressed gene signatures could serve as new potential biomarker to improve prognosis prediction in CC. The TCGA RNA sequencing data [306 cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and endocervical adenocarcinoma samples and 13 adjacent samples] and GEO data (GSE9750 and GSE52903 datasets) were integrated and performed a bioinformatics analysis. Results: The results showed that CC-associated FAM83A gene serves as a key regulator of CC development and progression. Functionally, we observed that FAM83A is significantly overexpressed in CC, which is linked to poor overall survival as well as disease-free survival in CC patients. The in-vitro and in-vivo assessments performed after silencing FAM83A revealed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited and the S-phase cell cycle arrest was induced. Mechanistically, FAM83A plays a role in PI3K/AKT signaling, and its downstream molecules could promote CC cell proliferation. Furthermore, functionality assessments by in-vitro luciferase reporter system and immunoblot analysis showed that miR-206 was the upstream of FAM83A and negatively correlated with FAM83A.

Early diagnosis and early treatment can reduce the mortality rate of cervical cancer. However, there is still no specific biomarkers for the diagnosis and detection of cervical cancer prognosis. Therefore, it is greatly urgent in searching biomarkers correlated with the diagnosis and prognosis of cervical cancer. Results: The mRNA and microRNA expression profile datasets (GSE7803, GSE9750, GSE63514, and GSE30656) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). The three microarray datasets were integrated to one via integrated bioinformatics. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and microRNAs (DEMs) were obtained by R software. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the DEGs were performed from the STRING database and further visualized by Cytoscape software. A total of 83 DEGs and 14 DEMs were screened from the microarray expression profile datasets. The miRNAs validated to be associated with cervical cancer were obtained using HMDD online website and the target genes of DEMs were identified using the miRWalk2.0 online database. ESR1, PPP1R3C, NSG1, and TMPRSS11D were the gene targets of hsa-miR-21; the targets of hsa-miR-16 were GYS2, ENDOU, and KLF4. These targets were all downregulated in cervical cancer. Finally, we verified the expression of those targets in cervical tissues from TCGA and GTEx databases and analyzed their relationship with survival of cervical cancer patients. In the end, the expression of key genes in cervical cancer tissues was verified via experiment method, we found KLF4 and ESR1 were downregulated in tumor tissues. Conclusion: This study indicates that KLF4 and ESR1 are downregulated by the upregulated miR21 and miRNA16 in cervical cancer, respectively, using bioinformatics analysis, and the lower expression of KLF4 and ESR1 is closely related to the poor prognosis. They might be of clinical significance for the diagnosis and prognosis of cervical cancer, and provide effective targets for the treatment of cervical cancer.","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","Journal Article"

Here, we used newly established immortalized human keratinocytes with a well-defined HPV16 E6E7 expression cassette to get a more complete and less biased overview of global changes induced by HPV16 by employing transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). This is the first study combining transcriptome and proteome data to characterize the impact of HPV oncogenes in human keratinocytes in comparison with their virus-negative counterparts. To enhance the informative value and accuracy of the RNA-Seq data, four different bioinformatic workflows were used. We identified potential novel upstream regulators (e.g., CNOT7, SPDEF, MITF, and PAX5) controlling distinct clusters of genes within the HPV-host cell network as well as distinct factors (e.g., CPPED1, LCP1, and TAGLN) with essential functions in cancer. Validated results in this study were compared to data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), demonstrating that several identified factors were also differentially expressed in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC) and HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCs). This highly integrative approach allows the identification of novel HPV-induced cellular changes that are also reflected in cancer patients, providing a promising omics data set for future studies in both basic and translational research.IMPORTANCE Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers still remain a big health problem, especially in developing countries, despite the availability of prophylactic vaccines. Although HPV oncogenes have been intensively investigated for decades, a study applying recent advances in RNA-Seq and quantitative proteomic approaches to a precancerous model system with well-defined HPV oncogene expression alongside HPV-negative parental cells has been missing until now. Here, combined omics analyses reveal global changes caused by the viral oncogenes in a less biased way and allow the identification of novel factors and key cellular networks potentially promoting malignant transformation. In addition, this system also provides a basis for mechanistic research on novel key factors regulated by HPV oncogenes, especially those that are confirmed in vivo in cervical cancer as well as in head and neck cancer patient samples from TCGA data sets.","Adenocarcinoma|Carcinogenesis|Carcinoma, Squamous Cell|Cell Transformation, Neoplastic|Computational Biology|Female|Gene Expression Profiling|Gene Regulatory Networks|High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing|Human papillomavirus 16|Humans|Keratinocytes|Oncogene Proteins, Viral|Proteome|Proteomics|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck|Transcriptome|Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","Oncogene Proteins, Viral|Proteome","NA","NA","NA","NA","Journal Article|Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"

The extent and biological significance of viral presence/infection in actual tumor samples is generally unknown but could be measured using human transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from tumor samples. We present an open source bioinformatics pipeline viGEN, which allows for not only the detection and quantification of viral RNA, but also variants in the viral transcripts. The pipeline includes 4 major modules: The first module aligns and filter out human RNA sequences; the second module maps and count (remaining un-aligned) reads against reference genomes of all known and sequenced human viruses; the third module quantifies read counts at the individual viral-gene level thus allowing for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between case and controls groups. The fourth module calls variants in these viruses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available pipelines or packages that would provide this type of complete analysis in one open source package. In this paper, we applied the viGEN pipeline to two case studies. We first demonstrate the working of our pipeline on a large public dataset, the TCGA cervical cancer cohort. In the second case study, we performed an in-depth analysis on a small focused study of TCGA liver cancer patients. In the latter cohort, we performed viral-gene quantification, viral-variant extraction and survival analysis. This allowed us to find differentially expressed viral-transcripts and viral-variants between the groups of patients, and connect them to clinical outcome. From our analyses, we show that we were able to successfully detect the human papilloma virus among the TCGA cervical cancer patients. We compared the viGEN pipeline with two metagenomics tools and demonstrate similar sensitivity/specificity. We were also able to quantify viral-transcripts and extract viral-variants using the liver cancer dataset. The results presented corresponded with published literature in terms of rate of detection, and impact of several known variants of HBV genome. This pipeline is generalizable, and can be used to provide novel biological insights into microbial infections in complex diseases and tumorigeneses.

Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the process of tumor biological functions. This study aimed to mine lymph node metastasis-associated lncRNAs and investigate their potential pathophysiological mechanism in cervical cancer lymph node metastasis. We applied the lncRNA-mining approach to identify lncRNA transcripts represented on Affymetrix human genome U133 plus 2.0 microarrays from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and then by validation in clinical specimens. The biological role and molecular mechanism of these lncRNAs were predicted by bioinformatic analysis. Subsequently, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and survival curve were conducted to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of candidate lncRNAs. In total, 234 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified to significantly associate with pelvic lymph node metastasis in early-stage cervical cancer. Our qRT-PCR results were consistent with the mining analysis (P<0.05). The functional enrichment analysis suggested that these lncRNAs may be involved in the biological process of lymph node metastasis. The ROC curves demonstrated satisfactory discrimination power of MIR100HG and AC024560.2 with areas under the curve of 0.801 and 0.837, respectively. Survival curve also indicated that patients with high MIR100HG expression had a tendency of poor prognosis. This is the first study to successfully mine the lncRNA expression patterns in PLNM of early-stage cervical cancer. MIR100HG and AC024560.2 may be a potential biomarkers of PLNM and these lncRNAs may provide broader perspective for combating cervical cancer metastasis.","Adult|Biomarkers, Tumor|Carcinoma, Squamous Cell|Female|Gene Expression|Gene Ontology|Gene Regulatory Networks|Humans|Kaplan-Meier Estimate|Lymphatic Metastasis|Middle Aged|Neoplasm Staging|RNA, Long Noncoding|Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","Biomarkers, Tumor|RNA, Long Noncoding","NA","NA","NA","NA","Journal Article"
